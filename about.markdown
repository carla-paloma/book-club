### On Choosing a Book

From June 2020 onwards, we will use a 48 hours anonymous [open poll](https://www.poll-maker.com/) system to choose a book.
You will be notifed once the decision is made.
If your book is chosen, please provide a short reason why you choose a book.
Please make sure there is a free EPUB version online or available to share.

Unless preferred, we only use a first name or user name for confidentiality reasons.
Once finished, think about three words that will describe the book of the month.
If you could give a rating out of 5 to the book that would be great.
