## FAQs

**What type of people will make up the club?**

Light and hardcore geeks who seldom get bored because they find most topics fascinating or exciting.

**What types of books will your club primarily read? Fiction? Non-fiction?**

Everything is welcome.

Sure! Anyone in the book club can lead the group. Just express your interest prior our jit.si gathering.

**What are the minimum and maximum number of members?**

The maximum amount of members is ten. We have a couple of new members as for July 2020. 

**When will the next meeting take place?**

You have 4 weeks approx. to read the book. After 4 weeks, you will receive details to a jit.si gathering.
Because of time zone differences, there will be two different jit.si  gatherings.
Naturally, some members will not show up. No stress.

It's up to you. You could re-read it or wait for the following month's book choice. Feel free to join the video call, share whatever you remember.
